# flame_texturepacker

A flame plugin to import sprite sheets generated by [Gdx Texture Packer][2] and [Code and Web Texture Packer][1]

## Install from Dart Pub

Include the following to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flame_texturepacker: any
 ```
 
## Usage
 
Drop generated atlas file and sprite sheet images into the  `assets/` and link the files in your `pubspec.yaml` file:
 
```yaml
 assets:
    - assets/spriteSheet.atlas
    - assets/spriteSheet.png
 ```
 
Import the plugin like this:

`import 'package:flame_texturepacker/flame_texturepacker.dart';`
 
Load the TextureAtlas passing the path of the sprite sheet atlas file:

```Dart
final atlas = await fromAtlas('FlameAtlasMap.atlas');
```

Get a list of sprites ordered by their index, you can use the list to generate an animation:
 
```Dart
final spriteList = atlas.findSpritesByName('robot_walk');

final animation = SpriteAnimation.spriteList(
 spriteList,
 stepTime: 0.1,
 loop: true,
);
 ```

Get individual sprites by name:

```Dart
final jumpSprite = atlas.findSpriteByName('robot_jump')!;
final fallSprite = atlas.findSpriteByName('robot_fall')!;
final idleSprite = atlas.findSpriteByName('robot_idle')!;
```
